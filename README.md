# Number_guessing_game
A fun little game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where you try to guess the number...
...and get verbally destroyed if you're too off. 😎

🕹️ How It Works
The browser picks a random number between 1 and 100.

You type in your guess and hit submit.

The game responds with:

"Too low. Just like your grades."

"Too high. Calm down, you're not Elon Musk."

"Correct! Finally, some brain cells are working."
